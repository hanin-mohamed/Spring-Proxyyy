## What is a Proxy?

A proxy is like a middleman that sits between you and the actual object (a Spring bean). It adds extra functionality, like logging or transaction management, before or after calling the real method.

📌 In simple words: **A proxy is a helper that wraps your code to add special behavior.**

##
Spring uses proxies to add "magic" to your code without you needing to write it. For example:

📍Transactions (@Transactional): Ensures database operations are saved or rolled back correctly.

📍Async execution (@Async): Runs methods in a separate thread for better performance.

📍Caching: Stores results to avoid repeating work.

📍Security: Checks permissions before running a method.

📍Lazy Loading: Loads data only when needed (e.g., in Hibernate).

↪️ How it works: When you call a method on a Spring bean, you’re actually calling the proxy. The proxy decides what to do before or after the real method runs.
##

##  Types of Proxies in Spring

Spring creates proxies in **two ways**:

| Proxy Type         | When Used                          | How It Works                                |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **JDK Dynamic Proxy** | If your class implements an interface | The proxy pretends to be the interface.      |
| **CGLIB Proxy**       | If your class doesn’t have an interface | The proxy creates a subclass at runtime.     |

 **Tip:** Always use interfaces (e.g., `MyService`) to make proxies work smoothly.

##  How a Proxy Works 

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Controller ->> Proxy: Call myMethod()
    Proxy ->> Advice: Add extra logic (e.g., @Transactional)
    Advice ->> RealBean: Run the actual method
    RealBean -->> Advice: Return result
    Advice -->> Proxy: Apply more logic if needed
    Proxy -->> Controller: Send final result
```
The diagram shows how a method call flows in Spring Boot using a proxy.

The Controller starts by calling a method, which goes to the Proxy first.

The Proxy passes it to Advice to add extra logic (like @Transactional), then to the RealBean to execute.

The result returns through Advice and Proxy back to the Controller.

##  Proxy Limitations (What Doesn’t Work?)

| Problem              | Why It Happens                                                                 |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Self-invocation**  | Calling a method from the same class (e.g., `this.myMethod()`) skips the proxy |
| **Private methods**  | Proxies can't intercept private methods                                        |
| **Final methods**    | Proxies can't override final methods                                           |
| **Non-Spring beans** | If you create an object with `new`, Spring can’t add a proxy                  |
| **Direct calls**     | Proxies only work when called from outside the class                          |

📌 **Example – Self-invocation fails:**
```java
@Service
public class MyService {
    @Transactional
    public void outerMethod() {
        this.innerMethod(); // ❌ Proxy is bypassed – no transaction!
    }

    @Transactional
    public void innerMethod() {
        // DB operations here
    }
}
```

##   Common Use Cases

###  A. `@Transactional`

- **What it does:** Manages DB transactions (commit/rollback).
- **How it works:** Proxy starts transaction before the method, and commits/rolls back afterward.
- ⚠️ Works **only** when method is called **from outside** the class.

📌 **Example:**
```java
@Service
public class MyService {
    @Transactional
    public void saveData() {
        // DB logic – auto rollback on error
    }
}
```

❌ Doesn’t work if:
- Method is `private` or `final`
- Called via `this.saveData()` inside same class

---

### B. `@Async`

- **What it does:** Runs method in a different thread to speed things up.
- **How it works:** Proxy hands off method to thread pool executor.

📌 **Example:**
```java
@Service
public class MyService {
    @Async
    public void sendEmail() {
        // Runs in a background thread
    }
}
```

❌ Doesn’t work if:
- Method is called via `this.sendEmail()` inside same class
- Bean is not managed by Spring
- Exception is thrown before returning `CompletableFuture`

📌 **Using custom thread pool:**
```java
@Configuration
public class AsyncConfig {
    @Bean(name = "customExecutor")
    public Executor taskExecutor() {
        ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
        executor.setCorePoolSize(5);
        executor.setMaxPoolSize(10);
        executor.setQueueCapacity(25);
        executor.initialize();
        return executor;
    }
}
```

```java
@Service
public class MyService {
    @Async("customExecutor")
    public void sendEmail() {
        // Runs with custom thread pool
    }
}
```

## Proxy Behavior in Action

| Scenario                              | Proxy Works? | Why                                           |
|---------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `this.myMethod()`                     | ❌           | Skips proxy                                   |
| Method called from controller         | ✅           | Goes through proxy                            |
| `@Async` with `CompletableFuture`     | ✅           | Proxy handles it correctly                    |
| Exception thrown before return        | ❌           | Proxy can't catch it – no async behavior      |

###  Normal Proxy Call

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Controller] --> B[Proxy]
    B --> C[Extra Logic]
    C --> D[Real Bean]
    D --> C
    C --> B
    B --> A
```

###  Async Thread Switch

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Controller ->> Proxy: Call @Async method
    Proxy ->> ThreadPool: Submit task
    ThreadPool ->> NewThread: Run method
    NewThread -->> RealBean: Do the work
```
The diagram shows how an @Async method works in Spring Boot.

The Controller calls the method, and the Proxy submits it to the ThreadPool.

The ThreadPool assigns it to a NewThread, which runs the method in the RealBean.

This allows the task to run in the background without blocking the Controller.

#  Hibernate Lazy Proxy in Spring


##  What is Lazy Loading?

**Lazy Loading** means:

> Hibernate will not load related data (e.g., collections or associations) until you access it.

Instead of returning the real data (like a list of books), Hibernate returns a **proxy object** that delays loading until needed.

📌 Example:
```java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "author", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
private List<Book> books;

Author author = repo.findById(1L).orElseThrow();
// No query for books yet

author.getBooks(); // triggers SQL
```

---

##  What Is a Hibernate Lazy Proxy?

Hibernate creates a proxy class (like `PersistentBag`) that:

-  Delays loading actual data  
-  Holds reference to the Hibernate **Session**  
-  Loads data when `.size()`, `.get()`, or `.iterator()` is called  

---

##  When Does It Work?

| Situation                           | Works? | Reason                                 |
|-------------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------|
| Inside `@Transactional`             | ✅     | Session is still open                  |
| Inside controller (`open-in-view`)  | ✅     | Session kept open for request          |
| After transaction ends              | ❌     | Session closed = proxy fails           |
| After entity serialization          | ❌     | Session reference lost in JSON         |

---

##  Why Does It Fail?

Hibernate proxies depend on an active `Session`. If closed:

```java
System.out.println(author.getBooks().size());
```

You get:

```bash
LazyInitializationException: could not initialize proxy – no Session
```

 Internally:
```java
if (this.session == null || !this.session.isOpen()) {
    throw new LazyInitializationException("No Session");
}
```

##  Diagram – Hibernate Lazy Proxy Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Controller
    participant S as Service
    participant H as Hibernate
    participant DB as Database

    C ->> S: loadAuthor(id)
    S ->> H: findById(id)
    H ->> DB: SELECT * FROM authors WHERE id=?
    H -->> S: returns Author + Lazy Proxy (books)
    S -->> C: returns Author

    C ->> Author: getBooks().size()
    alt Session is open
        H ->> DB: SELECT * FROM books WHERE author_id=?
        H -->> Author: returns books
    else Session closed
        H ->> Exception: LazyInitializationException
    end
```

The sequence diagram shows how Lazy Loading works:

The Controller asks the Service to load an Author by id.
The Service uses Hibernate to fetch the Author from the Database, returning it with a Lazy Proxy for books.
When getBooks().size() is called, if the Session is open, Hibernate fetches the books data; if closed, it throws a LazyInitializationException.

##  Common Fixes

| Strategy              | Description                                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `@Transactional`      |  Keeps the Hibernate Session open during the operation, allowing the Lazy Proxy to fetch data safely when needed.                    |
| `join fetch`          | Fetches related data (e.g., books) along with the parent (e.g., Author) in a single database call, avoiding multiple queries                |
| DTO projection        | Fetch only what you need: Creates a custom object with just the required fields, bypassing the Lazy Proxy and preventing session issues.                           |
| `@EntityGraph`        | Control eager loading declaratively: Defines which relationships to load eagerly using annotations, giving fine-tuned control over data fetching.                  |
| `open-in-view=true`   | (Caution) Keeps session open for web requests: Extends the Hibernate Session throughout the web request, but it may impact performance.       |
| `fetch = EAGER`       | Always load with parent (not recommended for large collections): Forces Hibernate to load related data immediately with the parent, which can slow down the app if the data is big. |
